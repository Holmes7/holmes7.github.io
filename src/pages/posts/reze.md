**Please watch Chainsaw Man: The Reze Arc, or else none of this will make sense. Spoilers Ahead**

I’m still recovering from the emotional damage of the new Chainsaw Man movie.
It’s so sad to think Denji kept waiting the whole night, believing Reze had dumped him.
He’ll always think she never came back.
He’ll never know she died just a few steps behind him.

The only time Reze ever felt true love
She found something she didn’t even know she wanted until it was too late.
To be denied even the chance to speak those words

Fuck Makima.

As a viewer, I was living the story through Denji’s eyes.
The slice-of-life romance? I felt it.
The betrayal? I felt that too.

I remember Denji falling for Reze’s words again 
her saying she still loved him
right after she tried to kill him
I thought the same as Aki
_How can someone be so gullible?_

And then the beach
Denji, sitting there, sparing her life.
Knowing full well that she might try to kill him again
Still saying he’ll wait for her at the café
How dumb is this guy?

---

But later, I kept thinking
What if I were Denji?
Of course I won't make the same dumb decisions
But… Reze did come back, didn’t she?
She tried to meet him

So whose decisions were really dumb?

Maybe being gullible isn’t so bad
Maybe it’s even necessary
in the complicated world of human relationships

I know I’ll go back to my cynical self in a couple of days
But the one having these thoughts is also me
Even if it only lasts for a little while
So I want to remember him too
