I am beautiful, I say it plain,
I burn bright and keep my name
My kindness shows; my help is true
I cannot be ugly; I am not you.

The mirror showed me something ugly,
its filthy glass was clouded, surely
I smashed the frame, it could not be
for only beauty lives within me

My misery drove me to his door,
the wisest man, revered in lore
He showed me ugly at my core
A fool he is, and nothing more

The real wise are those who call me great,
who see my beauty, true and straight
I flood them with love and prize,
for only they see with honest eyes

The mirror lies, the wise are fools,
the world is blind with broken rules
One truth remains, whatever they say
I am beautiful, come what may.
