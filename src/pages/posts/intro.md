Welcome to my thoughts.

This blog is one of my desperate attempts to leave a legacy—an effort to achieve a kind of immortality.
My intention is to speak to a very specific kind of person, hoping that my thoughts will resonate with them, even in a small way.
Just as I've been shaped by the ideas of those who came before me, I hope a part of me might live on through the people I reach.
I know many of these ideas might turn out to be garbage—but I'm hopeful there are a few diamonds hidden among them.
Also, my thoughts and opinions can change when presented with good reasoning, so some of what you read here might be outdated. Think for yourself.

And if you don't like what you read—or don't understand it, which I suspect may often be the case—know that you are not the intended audience. I'm not trying to cater to the majority. Leave.

I am not a writer or a poet. I simply want to express my thoughts in a beautiful way. To make my writing more readable, engaging, or poetic, I use some help from AI.
However, I never ask AI to generate ideas—those are entirely my own. I don't want to take credit for anything that isn't truly mine.
I do understand a bit about what makes writing pleasant or poetic (I am trying to learn more on this), so I also use that knowledge to guide my choices.
