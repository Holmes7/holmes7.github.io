I helped them.
But did I really help them?

Was it out of genuine care—or because I wanted something in return?
Did I hope they'd feel indebted to me?

Was it for the video, the likes, the fleeting taste of internet glory?
Or because someone I admired was watching, and I wanted to seem admirable too?

Maybe I was chasing karma—hoping that by helping them, someone would one day help me.
Or perhaps I’m repaying a debt, one that was never asked for but still lingers.

Maybe I helped them because I was promised a place in heaven,
or because I believed that good deeds could erase my sins.

So I wonder...
Did I really help them—or was I just trying to help myself all along?
