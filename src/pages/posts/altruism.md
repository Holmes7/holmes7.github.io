I helped them.

But did I really help them?
<br></br>

Maybe I helped them so that they would owe me something.

Maybe I helped them just to record a video and gain some internet fame.

Maybe I helped them because someone I know was watching, and I wanted them to think highly of me.

Maybe I helped them hoping that someone else will help me in the future.

Maybe someone helped me in the past, and I feel like I still owe something in return.

Maybe I helped them because I was told a place in heaven would be reserved for me.

Maybe I helped them because I was told that good deeds can wash away sins.
<br></br>

So I ask againâ€”did I really help them, or was I just helping myself all along?
