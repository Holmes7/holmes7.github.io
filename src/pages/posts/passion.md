Most people spend about **12% of their lives working**. That is a significant chunk of the limited gift of time we have here. If we also factor in the time people spend **worrying about work** or **being stressed about it**, it’s easy to see that the kind of work we do has a **strong impact on our entire life**.

So it makes sense to make a good decision when choosing your career. This has been one of the major problems in my life that I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about. In this blog, I want to share my findings from this journey, to help you make a **more informed decision** when trying to find your passion.

## Thinning the Herd

This blog is **not** for people whose primary goal is to chase **wealth, status, or fame** at any cost, without caring about the nature of the work itself. I simply don’t resonate with that way of thinking, and if that’s your mindset, you probably won’t find much value here.

This is a very **opinionated** article, and I don’t intend to cater to the majority.

## Redefining Passion

You know, I truly **hate the word _passion_**.

Why? Because its meaning has become so **diluted** that everyone seems to have their own version.

I remember watching _3 Idiots_ (a Bollywood movie) when I was a kid. While it did a great job of inspiring a generation to follow their passions in a positive way, I don’t think it did a very good job of actually **defining what passion means**. And I keep seeing this same issue again and again among people who strongly advocate for “following your passion.”

Because of this, I’ve seen people build **unrealistic expectations** around that word. They start believing that once they find their passion, they’ll **enjoy every single second** of their work. They go searching for something that feels like that, and unsurprisingly, never find it. Because it **does not exist**.

That’s a **pipe dream**.

So let me try to redefine what we’re actually looking for when choosing a career.

How about thinking of it as **something you’re genuinely excited to work on**? The goal isn’t to enjoy every minute of it — that’s impossible. You just need to feel **excited about doing it** most of the time. And I truly believe that’s more than enough to bring **real fulfillment** at work.

So if doing something doesn’t spark even a bit of excitement in you, I think that’s a pretty good sign that **it’s probably not for you**.

## Reason

This is something very common with students preparing for **IAS, IIT, or any big competitive exam**. They **hate every bit of it**, yet somehow they keep going, powered by a **strong reason**. Maybe it’s family expectations, heartbreak, or a burning urge to prove something to the world. The reasons differ, but the story’s the same: that **emotional fire** becomes the fuel that helps them **push through all the pain and struggle**.

While these emotional drivers can provide short-term motivation, in my opinion, this approach is **not sustainable**. A career lasts for decades, and constantly forcing yourself through something you dislike only **amplifies stress over time**.

When you’re doing work you genuinely enjoy, you don’t need to keep reminding yourself **why** you’re doing it. The work itself pulls you in.

So here’s a key indicator: if you constantly have to **justify** why you’re doing something, it’s probably **not your passion**.

## Money

“**Passion won’t pay your bills**.” That’s the usual argument against following your passion, and honestly, I agree to an extent.
If your work doesn’t earn you enough to live, it’s just a **hobby**.

But what I don’t agree with is the assumption that following your passion automatically means you’ll be broke. That’s simply not true.

Money versus passion is a **tradeoff**, and you need to find the right balance for yourself. Ask yourself: **How much money is enough for you?** If your goal is to become a millionaire by 30, you’ll naturally rule out many options. But if you go too far in the other direction and ignore money completely, you’ll struggle to sustain your passion long term. The lack of money will eventually eat you up from the inside.

Also, when you research salaries, **don’t just look at averages**. If you truly love what you do, chances are you’ll be **above average** in that field. Have some confidence.

## What’s Next

This is just **Part 1** of a multi-part series.
I have more ideas on this topic to share in upcoming posts.
