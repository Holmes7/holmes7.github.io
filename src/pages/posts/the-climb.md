I used to slip through secret doors,
As music hummed from velvet floors.
Colors whirled in endless streams,
And I would float inside my dreams.

But each time I looked to the sky
A lonely peak would catch my eye
A mountain crowned in silver light—
It whispered tales of a brighter sight.

I told myself, "The world can wait
This is no time to pause or rest
Climb the heights while strength is near—
The world I love will still be here"

So up I went through wind and stone,
My only guide, a dream unknown
Each step a toll, each breath a fight—
I chased the myth of the higher sight.

And now I stand where once I gazed,
The sky is pale, the wind a haze
I rest and search that world again,
But silence answers back with pain.

The colors faded, the songs hushed,
The joy I knew reduced to dust.
I ask the sky, “Where did it go—
That world I loved, so long ago?”

The sky answered, “The world stands true,
Its music still sings in colored hues
But wonder fades when hearts grow tight
You lost the eyes that made it bright.”

It was the child who lit the flame,
Who gave the magic all its name.
And on the climb, with every stride,
I left that joyful self behind.

If I could reach across the years,
I’d whisper low in that boy’s ears:
“Stay here a while, and live it deep—
These are the days your soul will keep.”

But time has closed that open door,
The child within me is no more.
So now I watch, with silent eyes,
As wonder fades from open skies.
