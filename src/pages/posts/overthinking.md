And once again, I’m back with another crazy, radical thought.

If you google "overthinking," you’ll find it’s almost always portrayed negatively. Everyone’s offering advice on how to stop it — meditation, mindfulness, you name it. And that advice is probably right for most of the world: the surface-level thinkers and emotional decision makers. They’re anyways unlikely to solve the problem they’re facing, no matter how much they overthink it.

But here’s my take: overthinking can actually be a powerful advantage. For some people, it might even be one of the strongest weapons in their arsenal. Because only with obsessive overthinking can you solve a seemingly unsolvable problem. Yes, you might not be able to focus on anything else. But that’s your power. Only you can solve that problem.

## My Precious Long Challenges

Back in my university days, I loved participating in programming contests. Most were two to three hours long, but there was one that lasted ten whole days. Unlike most others in the community, I loved them. I would literally spend five or six days thinking about a single problem — much harder than the ones in shorter contests. Whether eating, bathing, or sitting in class, I’d be working on the problem in my mind.

I’d also research existing algorithms that might solve parts of the problem. This was how I learned new techniques and data structures. And eventually, I’d crack it. And the feeling of accomplishment was something else.

## What If We Applied This to Everyday Overthinking?

You might think this is different — this is about emotions and feelings. But look deeper. You’ll see that your overthinking often comes from unanswered questions and confusion, some of them even about how to make future decisions.

The usual advice is designed to make you stop caring about those questions. That’s one way to stop overthinking. But I suggest the opposite: face the questions head-on. Once you find answers, the overthinking will stop. Think of it as a huge puzzle. And obsess the hell over it.

## Two Kinds of Overthinking

Let’s break it down. There are two basic kinds of overthinking in my opinion:

Obsessing over the past – like replaying an awkward conversation a hundred times, wondering if you messed up.
Obsessing over the future – Imagining everything that could go wrong, even if it’s unlikely.

You’ll do both of these regardless. But I’m suggesting you change your approach.

When looking at the past, treat it like detective work. Look for clues that can help solve your puzzle. Review everything you know, and if the information isn’t enough, search for more. Use the internet, talk to people, even hire experts if needed. More information = more clues = higher chances of solving the problem.

When thinking about the future, critically plan how you’ll handle potential unfavourable situations. This will force you to stay prepared, even for bad scenarios. And it’ll help you make much better decisions today.

## Keep a Problem-Solving Mindset

The key is to maintain a problem-solving attitude instead of feeling sorry for yourself. Eventually, you’ll reach a point where you’re ready to make a decision. And you’ll be far more prepared than if you had just avoided overthinking or drowned in your feelings.

And once you make this decision, you'll be free that you tried your best and with whatever information you could get, you made the best decision.

## A Personal Example: Choosing a Job

About a year ago, I was switching jobs. After a bad experience at my first job, I knew I had to make the right choice. I had several offers, and the decision was critical.

During interviews, I critically assessed the interviewers’ character and company culture. I used to ask unique questions to encourage them to reveal things they normally wouldn't. I even insisted on speaking directly with my future managers everytime to gauge their personality and passion. I even made a list of reasons and assumptions for choosing each company and ran thought experiments: What if one of these reasons or my deduction turns out to be wrong? What would my position be then, and how would I handle it?

It was stressful. My mom even noticed and suggested I just make a decision and be done with it. But I’m glad I did all those calculations. Even if things go wrong later, I’ll know I considered those possibilities beforehand. That means the decision I made was still the best one, and I won’t blame myself for it. And knowing this is incredibly calming.
