There are many kinds of fools in this world
Fools who betray their own soul for others,
Fools who toss away what they have for something they will never find, 
Fools who ignore the signs until it’s far too late.

But the ones I pity the most are the fools who cannot bear to live in ignorance.

They cannot look away from the cracks in the surface; they keep pulling at the loose ends, digging deeper and deeper.

They call it a quest for wisdom, for clarity, but it’s really a hunger they can’t silence. They believe the truth will bring peace, yet with every step closer, they feel that peace slipping further away.

And the answers bring with them a shattering realization, that the lies they despised were the only things keeping everything from falling apart. And now, knowing everything, they cannot unsee it.

If I were to meet such a fool, I would want to save them — to tell them to stop, to turn back, to cling to the fragile happiness they still possess.
But deep down, I know it’s already too late

Because, in truth, I am that fool.

> Here the ways of men divide. If you wish to strive for peace of soul and happiness, then believe; if you wish to be a disciple of truth, then inquire - Friedrich Nietzsche
