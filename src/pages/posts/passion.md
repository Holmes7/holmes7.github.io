For most of us, we spend a third of our life at work. That is a significant chunk of the limited gift of time we have. So it makes sense to make a good decision when choosing your career. This has been one of the major problems in my life that I have given a lot of time to think about and solved it to a great extent in my own life.

In this blog, I want to share my findings on this journey. I hope to give you a mindset to solve this problem in your own life as well. But you have to do the heavy lifting. You have to truly introspect, go deep within heart, think about the points I'm making. And most importantly, have the courage to act on it.

## Thinning the herd
This blog is NOT intended for the people who primarily only want to pursue wealth, status, fame in any way possible with no regards to the nature of the work they are doing. I simply don't resonate with this kind thinking and you won't find anything of value here.

This article will surely help you if:
1. You don't want to simply trade 1/3rd of your life for a paycheck .
2. You don't want to curse at your job everyday, dread mondays and live weekend to weekend, vacation to vacation.


## Redefining Passion
I hate the word "Passion"

Why? Because it's definition is so diluted these days, everyone has their own version. The movies asking us to follow our passions, never define the word correctly and people make some impossible expectations out of it. They think if one finds his passion, he'll euphoric every second he's working. 

This is a pipe dream. 

Let's try "the thing that you are excited to work on". The requirement isn't for you to enjoy each and every second of working on your craft, that's impossible. You just need to be excited about working on it. And I truly believe this is more than enough to have great fulfilment at work.

## Money
"Passion won't pay your bills" is a popular argument against following your passion. If you can't make money out of your work then it's just a hobby. And I agree with this. But what I don't agree with is people using this argument as if following your passion directly means you won't be making enough money. That's just dumb.

Money vs Passion is a tradeoff. And you need to do some research to find the right balance for yourself. How much money is enough for you? If you want to become a millionaire by 30, you directly eliminate a lot of career options. On the other hand, if you go too low on the money, now you have a lot of carrer options to choose from but you won't be able to sustain it long term as you sacrificed on the money a little too much.

Also keep in mind that when researching how much money a certain career choice makes, don't look at the average numbers. You are choosing what you love to do, obviously you'll be well above average in the field. Have some confidence.

I didn't choose to go the higher studies route as I couldn't come up with a good plan for the money side of things. But also during my college placements, I did not apply to any role other than software engineer even if they were giving very high packages. Because I am satisfied with the money in software.

## Position in Society 
I think this is by far the biggest contributor in people not pursuing work that they love. I understand that it is our natural instinct to climb the societal heirarchy, but sacrificing enjoyable work is too big of a price to pay in the long term. I'd suggest to try and detach your emotions from this as much as possible

## Transitioning with small steps
You don't need to resign from the current stream of income to pursue your passion. There's this chess channel I have been watching since I was 16. He now is quite big but back then he was a small channel. 

### 
I have a beautiful dev environment catered to my specific needs on my personal laptop and recently I wanted to use the same on my new work laptop. But due to additional security in the work laptop, I ran into some really frustrating issues. This was a very niche problem and very little help was available on the internet. I researched, read each line of the error log, trying to find some hack around the issue. 
After 7-8 days of frustrating struggle, I finally found a workaround and looking at everything finally work seamlessly was so satisfying. 
Now this does not fit into the

money
child
activity in which you are so engrossed you don't have to remind yourself why you are doing it
Strengths - don't enjoy talking to people, not good at understanding them, alone
money - above average.
small steps - me choosing jee over neet, agadmator moving to chess
