There are many kinds of fools in this world: 
Fools who chase after dreams that lead nowhere,
Fools who toss away what they have for something they will never find, 
Fools who ignore the signs until it’s far too late

But the ones I pity the most are the fools who cannot bear to live in ignorance.

They cannot look away from the cracks in the surface; they keep pulling at the loose ends, digging deeper and deeper, searching for truths that should have stayed buried. 
They call it a quest for wisdom, for clarity, but all they find is misery. They can never rest, not until they know everything — even if knowing it tears them apart.

In seeking truth, they lose their peace, blind to the fact that the lies they despise are the only things keeping everything from falling apart. 
For them, ignorance isn't bliss; it's a torment. And so, they dig on, no matter the cost.

If I were to meet such a fool, I would want to save them — to tell them to stop, to turn back, to cling to the fragile happiness they still possess. 
Yet, in the end, I would fall prey to the same fate, only to be eaten by them.

Because, in truth, I am that fool.
