In the comments, someone asked a simple yet striking question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Still wondering why she didn’t ask for his name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn’t resist replying with my interpretation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because she never cared about him as a person. She only cared about the way he idealized her, the way he loved her, the way he affirmed her beauty and existence. She cared only about filling the void of validation in her heart that her previous lover had created. It was never about the narrator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After that, I started scrolling through the other comments, curious to see how others had seen it.<br>
But to be honest, most of them felt… dry. Hollow. As if they’d only skimmed the surface, content with just knowing the tip of the iceberg. Like come on, we’re talking about Dostoevsky here.</p>
<p>And then, almost instinctively, my mind drifted back five years.</p>
<p>I remembered watching season three of <em>Oregairu</em> as it aired. Back then, it had this almost cult-like following. Every episode dissected and discussed to its bones. After each one, I’d find myself on this blog (I wish I could find it now), reading deep analyses and interpretations.</p>
<p>That show, much like Dostoevsky’s writing, was never just what it seemed. Every line, every look, every silence carried a weight of meaning beneath it. A beauty that would lose its charm if presented literally.</p>
<p>But after reading those essays, I often felt… defeated.<br>
How could people see these hidden layers so clearly while I saw only the surface?<br>
Why was I blind to what was right there between the lines?<br>
I used to wonder if I’d ever develop that sixth sense, the ability to feel the invisible, to understand what isn’t said.</p>
<p>Looking back, I think I have improved quite a lot. Now, I’m not saying I see anything and everything. Like I remember watching “The Menu” a couple years back and I was just as clueless as anyone else, had to read explanations for that as well. But I am not completely blind anymore.</p>
<p>So, I want to say this to the version of me who felt that way, and maybe to anyone who feels it now</p>
<p>You’ll get there.</p>
<p>Keep reading, keep observing, keep letting others’ insights guide you. Slowly, your brain will start forming patterns and one day, you’ll realize, you’ve learned to read not just the story, but the soul. To understand the philosophy that hides beneath what’s said. That you have grown the sixth sense after all.</p></article></div><footer id="contact" class="flex flex-col pb-8 pt-5 items-center space-y-6 md:flex-row md:justify-between md:space-y-0"><div class="text-center md:text-left"><p class="text-2xl mb-2">Ashutosh Patkar</p><div class="text-sm"><p>Made Performant with Astro</p><p>and Beautiful with TailwindCSS</p></div></div><section><div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 justify-center"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashutosh-patkar/" class="text-2xl hover:text-sky-300" aria-label="linkedin"><i class="decoration-sky-300 decoration-2 underline-offset-8 hover:underline fa-brands fa-linkedin"></i></a><a href="https://github.com/Holmes7" class="text-2xl hover:text-sky-300" aria-label="github"><i class="decoration-sky-300 decoration-2 underline-offset-8 hover:underline fa-brands fa-github"></i></a><a href="mailto:ashutoshpatkar71@gmail.com" class="text-2xl hover:text-sky-300" aria-label="email"><i class="decoration-sky-300 decoration-2 underline-offset-8 hover:underline fa-solid fa-envelope"></i></a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/_holmes7_/" class="text-2xl hover:text-sky-300" aria-label="instagram"><i class="decoration-sky-300 decoration-2 underline-offset-8 hover:underline fa-brands fa-instagram"></i></a><a href="https://medium.com/@ashutoshpatkar71" class="text-2xl hover:text-sky-300" aria-label="medium"><i class="decoration-sky-300 decoration-2 underline-offset-8 hover:underline fa-brands fa-medium"></i></a></div></section></footer></body></html>
