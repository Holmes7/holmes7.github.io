“It won’t come for me,” he said,
“It hunts the wicked—
I am the one who helps,
the holy, the clean.”

Looking away from the horrors,
was he shielding himself from the ugly,
or were his dreams too beautiful 
to truly let go?

A weak voice cried,
“Wake up, while there’s still time.
Your faith isn’t worth a dime.
You think you’re safe, but you are the prey.
You feed the beast by playing its way.”

“You speak of beasts and broken faith—
but have your hands ever bled?
If you’ve not suffered, you have no right
to speak of what lies ahead.”

Through stubborn pride
he could not feel,
the voice destroying
their own dreams to heal.

Then came the night
that tore his faith to blood,
ripped away his skin,
and left him naked in the mud—
to face the monstrous truth
he’d long denied

Losing everything,
he cried for eyes to see,
begged them to look—
but they turned away from the plea,
whispering cold,
“It won’t come for me.”
