It's funny to think that the person who has had the most impact on my life is a fictional character from a comedy anime. The anime I'm talking about is *One-Punch Man (Season 1)*, and the character is Saitama.

> I highly recommend watching the anime first. **Spoilers ahead**.

This anime is a masterpiece, with the potential to change how you see life. It’s one of those rare works I revisit whenever I feel lost. Here, I’m not providing a full summary but sharing a few philosophical ideas that resonated deeply with me. To set the mood, I recommend listening to the [OPM Sad OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zm2MnYBXHY) on loop while reading this.

## A Glimpse Into Saitama’s Mind

Right from the first scene, we get a peek into Saitama's perspective. He’s a hero "for fun."

He doesn’t fight for a noble cause, fame, or recognition—he fights because he enjoys it. As the story unfolds, we see him grappling with the disconnect between his incredible deeds and the lack of recognition. This feels unfair. He saves countless lives, so shouldn’t people be grateful? It’s a feeling many of us can relate to: working hard yet being overlooked. This theme keeps surfacing throughout the anime.

The answer, as the anime shows, is simple: Saitama isn’t registered in the Hero Registry. In this world, anyone doing heroic work without being part of the system is just seen as a weirdo.

## The Hero Registry

### A Commentary on Social Systems

The Hero Registry symbolizes the structures of society. We are all heroes in our own lives, battling personal monsters. The hero hierarchy mirrors real-world social systems: S-class heroes at the top enjoy respect, while C-class heroes struggle to be acknowledged. Then there are people like Saitama—those who follow their own path and work honestly, only to be dismissed as oddballs. Society often fails to recognize genuine effort unless it conforms to its rules.

As viewers, we root for Saitama to receive the recognition he deserves. But time and again, someone else gets the credit. It’s frustrating, isn’t it?

### What Kind of Hero Do You Want to Be?

Saitama eventually registers as a hero. Despite his unmatched strength, the system places him at the bottom. Does this mean he’s less of a hero? Less deserving of respect? This mirrors how our own social systems can be flawed and unfair.

After the exam, Saitama wonders if this is what being a hero really means—being defined by arbitrary ranks and titles.

It’s a question we’ve all faced at some point: *"Is this really what I’m supposed to be doing?"*

## The Meteor Arc

### Climbing the Ladder

In one memorable moment, Saitama saves an entire city by destroying a meteor—a task even the top S-class heroes couldn’t achieve. His rank rises from 342 to 5 in C-class. Here, we see his human side: he’s genuinely excited.

Even Saitama isn’t entirely above the desire for recognition. Climbing the social ladder, however flawed, gives us a sense of accomplishment. It’s natural, and there’s nothing wrong with it.

### The Ugly Side of Society

But things don’t go as expected. Instead of being celebrated, Saitama is blamed for the destruction caused by the meteor fragments. People ignore the fact that he saved them. Other heroes, driven by jealousy, attempt to humiliate him.

This exposes the harsh reality of society: people often focus on negatives or discredit the efforts of others out of envy.

Imagine a hero whose main motivation is admiration from others. Such a person would feel crushed in Saitama’s shoes, believing their efforts were in vain. But Saitama is different. While the public humiliation angers him, he endures it because his motivation comes from within.

The crowd’s opinions don’t dictate his sense of self-worth.

## The Deep Sea King Arc

### The Battle

The Deep Sea King arc offers many profound moments, but I’ll focus on Saitama. The Deep Sea King is incredibly strong, defeating heroes like Puri Puri Prisoner and Genos. Mumen Rider’s valiant but futile stand is heart-wrenching. When Saitama arrives, he congratulates Mumen Rider, appreciating his courage.

Saitama defeats the monster effortlessly in front of a large crowd. Finally, it seems like he’ll get the recognition he deserves. But when someone in the crowd suggests that only Saitama is a "real" hero, dismissing the efforts of others, Saitama takes a surprising step.

### True Heroism

This moment reveals Saitama’s real strength—not just physical, but moral. He could have accepted the praise and become popular. Instead, he asks himself: *At what cost?*

Would it be right for people to believe heroism is only about winning? Should they devalue the sacrifices of other heroes?

If life is a metaphorical battle, then each of us faces our own monsters. A small-time artist pursuing their passion may not earn as much as a wealthy businessman or gain fame like a superstar. But does that make their efforts any less valuable?

Saitama wasn’t impressed by Mumen Rider’s strength but by his spirit. To him, heroism isn’t about defeating monsters—it’s about fighting for what matters, regardless of the outcome.

Saitama lies to the crowd, claiming he only won because the other heroes weakened the monster. As a result, the people hate him, accusing him of stealing credit.

### What Really Matters?
The first time I watched this scene, I was just a 16 yr old kid and I was completely in awe. How can someone willingly invite public ridicule when he has done nothing to deserve it? How can someone's will be this strong? Just as a viewer I desperately wanted him to finally be recognised, so I can only imagine how much he would want it. Even then, he does what he believes in, without getting corrupted by fame and appreciation. This is just magical to me.

Over time, I started to question whether wanting appreciation is inherently wrong, questioning the motive behind each of my actions. As humans, we naturally crave recognition, fame, or validation— that's part of how we’ve evolved. However, if this becomes our primary motivation for everything we do, will it not eventually corrupt us? What if, in the end, after getting the recognition we wanted, we find that we’ve lost our true selves in the process? Would you say that was a fair bargain?

Saitama follows his heart irrespective of what society expects from him. It would definitely make him happy if people would appreciate what he's been doing, but he won't change himself just so he'd be appreciated.

### The Reward

Saitama doesn’t gain widespread fame or respect. Most people dismiss him as a fraud. **But**, he earns the genuine respect of a few people who see him for who he truly is.

And in the end, maybe they’re the only ones who truly matter.
